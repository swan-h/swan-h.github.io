    <p>
   
    My name is Swan Htun, and I am from Burma (Myanmar). 
    I am a Physics student with an avid interest in Computer Science and Mathematics as well. 
    One branch of Mathematics that's of particular interest to me is Graph Theory, which is also highly applicable to CS.   
    I just started at UIUC Fall 2017 as a transfer student from Santa Fe College (Gainesville, Florida). 
    I am drawn to examining sophisticated alternatives to overcome technological, anatomical and physiological barriers through research.
    I have moved around quite abit so adapting to changes, learning new cultures, meeting new people and being in new enviroment have become second nature to me.
