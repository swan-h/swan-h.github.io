    My name is Swan Htun, and I am from Burma (Myanmar). 
    I am a Physics student with an avid interest in Computer Science and Mathematics as well. One particular field of Mathematics that I am interested is Graph Theory, which is highly applicable to CS. 
    I just started at UIUC Fall 2017 as a transfer student from Santa Fe College (Gainesville, Florida). 
    I have moved around quite abit so adapting to changes and new enviroment has become second nature to me.
